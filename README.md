# scheduler
Export UNT schedules to iCalendar.

### Organization
Scheduler is divided into three Python files:

1. *main.py* - Contains main execution code to interface between webdriver and iCalendar.

2. *scraper.py* - Contains a class to facilitate scraping the UNT website for scheduling information.

3. *calendar.py* - Interfaces with iCalendar to build a .ics file.

There are three working branches:

1. *master* - Contains current version of application.

2. *scraping* - Used to make revisions to web scraping code / interface.

3. *calendar* - Used to make revisions to iCalendar integration code.
